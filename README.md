# Swinburne-Parking-slot-management
A parking slot management program that can manage the slots being assigned to the customers very effectively. It gives you an option of choosing what kind of vehicle you are trying to park and gives you a slot to park the vehicle in depending on your preferred time of stay. 

It will then calculate the total price of parking depending on the price of the slot and the time parked.

All the code is well documented and should be very easy to understand.
